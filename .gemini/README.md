This repository is pre-configured with a Gemini CLI extension that allows you to connect with the experimental rover MCP server in `scripts/simulation/mcp_server.py`. You can load the extension by running `gemini` from the root of this repository when Gemini CLI is installed. You can check out the Gemini CLI project and get started with it here:
